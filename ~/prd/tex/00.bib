title = {{The Contagion of Cheating}},
annote = {2.	According to ``The Contagion of Cheating'' by Grannis, what two different things did being encouraged to cheat make one more likely to do?  What was the unusual interaction between these two consequences of being encouraged to cheat?
5.	In ``The Contagion of Cheating,'' how did Grannis test whether students selectively associated with those holding similar predispositions?  How did this compare to Stannard and Bowers' method?  Which do you find more convincing and why?
13.	How is peer influence as discussed by Grannis in ``The Contagion of Cheating'' both similar to and different from the contextual factor of peer influence discussed by other researchers?  Discuss Grannis' measurement of peer influence and compare it with the measurement of peer influence used in at least three other assigned readings for the course.
20.	In ``The Contagion of Cheating,'' how did Grannis demonstrate that his findings, concerning the contagion of encouragement, were not merely the result of stable sets of students cheating and encouraging each other to do so?
29.	In ``The Contagion of Cheating,'' what did Grannis mean by social teaching?

1. Introduction  2
2. Theory 5
	Hypothesis: As the number of times a student is encouraged to cheat in an academic term increases, the number of times they cheat in that same academic term will increase. 7
	Hypothesis: As the number of times a student has been encouraged to cheat in an academic quarter increases, the number of times they encourage others to do so in that same quarter will increase. 8
	Hypothesis: The relationship between current encouragements to cheat received in an academic quarter and current cheating behavior in that same quarter will remain robust, controlling for time-lagged measurements of a student's own cheating behavior and encouragements to cheat they have received.  9
	Hypothesis: Controlling for individual factors, contextual factors, as well as beliefs about potential sanctions will not substantively diminish the above hypotheses' impact.  11
	Hypothesis: Individuals who encourage others to cheat in an academic quarter, but who do not themselves receive encouragement in that same quarter, will not cheat in that same quarter. 12

*They have data on 9 western nations, which cover all men aged 20-64.
*The authors assert that their data make for high quality comparisons between countries.
*They use the G-test instead of the chi2 as their fit statistic.
*They, at one point at least, use a 7-category, unordered (?:) class schema.

1. The authors' goal in the first section is to arrive at a model of a mobility table that can be used to conduct a test of the FJH (Featherman, Jones  and Hauser) hypothesis, which states that industrialized nations have the same mobility pattern. They distinguish a strong version, the common social fluidity model, and a weak version, the core social fluidity model, where the strong predicts that odds ratios for mobility tables will be statistically equivalent across countries (115), whereas the weak predicts that they will be similar but not identical.

Table 4.1 presents straightforward evidence that the CmSF model does not fit the data. Two models are presented. A baseline assumes that origins and destinations are independent conditional on national variation, and as expected this fails by a large margin. The common social fluidity model, or strong version of the FJH hypothesis, is a model that includes no three way interactions among nation, origin, and destination. Each are different from the data and they are also different from each other; indeed the CmSF explains 94.7% of the . Thus in a straightforward way the strong CmSF model is rejected.

The authors then attempt to define a model that can represent the weak form of the FJH hypothesis. They postulate a "core pattern of fluidity" that if detectable would support the FJH hypothesis. They reject representing the core pattern as a mere average model of fluidity across nations (117). Instead, they do the following:

1. Standardize each of the 9 country tables to n=10,000.
2. For each of 36 pairwise combinations (9 choose 2), fit the CmSF model.
3. The 36 G^2 fit statistics from these tests form a "dissimilarity matrix", which represents the "distances between each pair of nations in terms of their fluidity patterns" (118).
4. Input these G2 into a "multidimensional scaling exercise", and project plots that represent these "distances" in a three dimensional space.
5. Analyzing the projection obtained, they find England and France to be central.
6. They fit the CmSF to n-standardized England and France tables, and choose as their model of core social fluidity "the set of odds ratios that are implicit in the expected cell values under this model" (121).

Presumably only England and France fit this model reasonably well??

2. Given their establishment of a core pattern of social mobility free from nation level variation, the goal of section two is to develop a "sophisticated" topological model of intra and interclass mobility relationships. They develop four new dimensions within which they define parameters by different patterns of binary comparison (or blocking):

Hierarchy is a dimension that reduces the 7 category class scheme into three--an upper, middle, and lower class--which they describe in terms of desirability, resources, and barriers to entry. They present two tables, one representing "one step" transitions up or down the hierarchy, and another representing "two step" transitions from lower to upper classes, and vice versa (124).

Inheritance is a variable normally about the diagonal. In addition to blocking the diagonal, they develop two additional tables. One predicts higher inheritance for farmers, petty bourgeoisie, and professionals. A final predicts that farmer's sons, in addition to their prior treatment, are especially immobile. (126).

Sector is represented by one set of parameters; for two agricultural classes, farm laborers and farm managers, a common parameter is defined for movement into and out of agriculture (127). They predict a barrier to entry or exit from the agricultural sector. Recall that this is the effect given the marginals, since presumably there is gross mobility out of agriculture.

Affinity, finally, is a set of barriers between classes assumed to be based in status similarity that may be thought to transcend "internal" divisions like those defined by inheritance. It comprises two tables. First is a special parameter for "disaffinity" at the extremes of t...}
